# üöö Tracking Trucks - API Documentation

## üìö Complete API Reference

This is a comprehensive truck rental platform API built with Django REST Framework. The system transforms the traditional "Uber for Transport" model into a **"Tracking Trucks"** platform with a manager-mediated workflow that provides customers with price ranges without exposing vendor details.

## üõí Key Features

### **Customer Enquiry System**
- Customers submit enquiries with pickup/drop locations, dates, vehicle types, and load details
- System returns price ranges (not vendor details), number of vehicles available, and deal probability
- No direct vendor exposure until price range selection

### **Manager-Mediated Workflow**
- New "manager" role mediates all communication between customers and vendors
- Managers handle enquiry distribution to appropriate vendors
- Both vendor and customer must confirm through manager before order creation

### **Route-Based Pricing**
- Vendors define regular routes with fixed price ranges
- Support for miscellaneous (non-regular) routes with estimated pricing
- Automatic route matching for accurate pricing

## üîê Authentication

All authenticated endpoints require JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### User Roles
- **Customer**: Submit enquiries, select price ranges, confirm orders
- **Vendor**: Define routes, respond to enquiries, manage trucks
- **Manager**: Mediate between customers and vendors, manage enquiries
